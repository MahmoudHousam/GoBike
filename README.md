## GoBike System analysis

### Project Overview

This repo contains an explaratory data analysis for the GoBike system for bike sharing in SF. It contains data files form June 2018 to May 2019 with a record of more than 2 millions. The analysis amid at exploring trends in data regarding trip durations, seasons and months. This analysis is done through three level: univariate analysis, bivariate analysis and multivariate analysis. The data contains various and interesting infromation from age and gender to trip duration and start and end time of trip. I only extract 10% of the datasets not all of them due to memory usage performance. Ages in the dataset are ranging from 18 to 56 takes around 95% of the users in dataset.

### Conclusion

To sum up, the analysis ends up that the longest trip durations are in the summer specifically in August. Winter, in Sep and Jan, comes in the second place, while spring months come with shortest trip durations across the year. Unlike the previous bar chart that shows the longest median duratoin trip is in spring, the heatmap suggests the summer as duration count with longest ones. The second heatmap also prove the same fact that the summer has the peak duration of trips with high frequency in Wednesdays. The trip durations take more or less that 10 minutes.
